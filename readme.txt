Matrix Screen Saver for Microsoft Windows(r) 

Installation Instructions
Difficulty Level :: Beginner (takes me 2-3 min)

Matrix Resurrections :: In theaters this Christmas, 2021!

1) Download this GitHub repository.

2) Open your Microsoft Windows System directory which holds the system recognized screen saver files. This may require you to change your settings to allow "Show Hidden Files and Folders" before you can see the necessary system directory. 

You can search online for the appropriate screen saver location for your particular version of Microsoft Windows, but on all my Windows XP machines (physical and virtual), the directory holding .scr files is: 
C:\WINDOWS\system32

3) Move or Copy ONLY the .scr file (file path below) into the Microsoft Windows system directory which will also be holding all the other installed screen saver files. You can sort by file type to see them easily. These files will always end with .scr.

File path to Matrix screen saver file in this GitHub repository download ::
/scr/Matrixcode.scr

4) When you next load the Windows System display properties dialog with screen saver selection settings, you should see "Matrixcode" show up in the list among your choices for selection. Select it.

5) Feel free to use the built in screen saver settings feature to customize your Matrix code and enjoy!

6) If you needed to "Show Hidden Files and Folders", you can turn this setting back to hidden now.

7) Go see the movie in theaters everywhere in December!  :)
